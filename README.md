# Sprint4_T1_Spring_Introduction_Maven


Description:

This exercise introduces the SPRING framework.
You'll start using the HTTP protocol, using Postman, and discovering how to manage dependencies with Maven.

Level 1:

- Spring and Maven exercise:

This exercise is a first contact with Spring and Maven.
Access the page: https://start.spring.io/, and generate a Spring boot project with the following characteristics:

- [x] Import it into Eclipse using the option File > Import > Existing Maven Project.
- [x] In the application.properties file, set the server.port variable to the value 9000.

We will turn this application into a REST API:

- [x] Depending on the main package, create another subpackage called Controllers, and inside it, add the HelloWorldController class. It must have two methods:
- [x] String hi
- [x] String hi2

- [x] These two methods will receive a String parameter called name, and will return the phrase:
- “Hello, “ + name + “. You are running a Maven project”.

- [ ] The first method will respond to a GET request, and must be configured to receive the parameter as a RequestParam. The "name" parameter will have the default value "UNKNOWN". You will have to answer to:

- http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld
- http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld?name=My name

- [ ] The second method will respond to a GET request, and must be configured to receive the parameter as a PathVariable. The "name" parameter will be optional. You will have to answer to:

- http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld2
- http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld2/myname
